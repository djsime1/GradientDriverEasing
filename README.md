# GradientDriverEasing

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds [easing function](https://easings.net/) presets to [ValueGradientDriver](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:ValueGradientDriver) components.

**Depends on [CustomUILib](https://github.com/art0007i/CustomUILib) to add the inspector UI!**

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [CustomUILib.dll](https://github.com/djsime1/GradientDriverEasing/releases/latest/download/CustomUILib.dll) and [GradientDriverEasing.dll](https://github.com/djsime1/GradientDriverEasing/releases/latest/download/GradientDriverEasing.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
3. Start the game and browse to or create a ValueGradeintDriver component using the Inspector. Two new sections should appear on the component.
